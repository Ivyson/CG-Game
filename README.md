## Prerequisites

- A modern web browser with WebGL and HTML5 support.
- A code editor (optional, if you wish to modify the code).
- This code was only Tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and was not really functioning well on Mozilla Firefox. Not really Tested on Safari and any other browser, I would Appreciate feedback on how it works if you tried it on a different Browser.

# Bugs
1. PacMan is not rotating... The pacman Avatar is supposed to change texture to a pacman faced up when button up pressed etc...

3. The Ghosts are not having the algorithm for following Pacman
4. When The Pause button is pressed, then the game starts misbehaving... --fIXED--
